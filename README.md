## Description
The project is the first try to program a mathematical model describing the trajectory and other properties of space vehicle during the re-entry.

*Simulation.Backend* - a working folder of programmed maths models wrapped as ASP.NET Core Web API project

*Simulation.Frontend* - the frontend project in python written using [StreamLit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit)

Many thanks to other guys working on the project: Mattie Lousada Blaazer and Will Cliffe. Materials and ideas used in the project can be seen on the [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kqejVvE=/)

Simulation.Backend/Core has a clear class structure:
`SpaceVehicle` is inherited by `Shuttle` and `Capsule` (2 types of vehicles you can generally have in rocket science ðŸ™ƒ)
`SpaceVehicle` contains general equations to calculate different properties and further derivations used in further calculations.

`Shuttle` and `Capsule` override `CalculateBallisticCoeff()` and `CalculateLdCoeff()` which are used to calculate Ballistic and Lift-to-Drag coefficients correspondingly.

During runtime, after set period of time, the state of a space vehicle is captured and recorded in the `TimeFrame` instance.
When the space vehicle reach the minimum height, the simulation is stopped and the list of `TimeFrame` is returned.

## Installation and Usage
No extra libraries are required for c# project. So, just make sure you have got **dotnet 3.1** on your machine.

So, the code can simply be run by:

```bash
cd Simulation.Backend
dotnet restore
dotnet run #runs the web api app
dotnet test #runs tests in Simulation.Tests
```
